description: Safe refactoring workflow with comprehensive testing and quality validation
---

I'll perform safe refactoring using a systematic approach with multiple agents:

1. Use the code-reviewer agent to analyze the current code and identify refactoring opportunities and potential risks
2. Use the unit-tester agent to ensure comprehensive test coverage exists before refactoring begins
3. Use the coder agent to implement the refactoring following modern conventions and best practices
4. Use the code-reviewer agent again to validate the refactored code maintains quality and doesn't introduce issues

This ensures refactoring is done safely with proper test coverage and quality validation at each step.
