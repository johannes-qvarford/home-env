description: Complete feature implementation with automated testing and quality assurance
---

I'll implement this feature using a collaborative approach with multiple agents:

1. Use the coder agent to implement the functionality following modern conventions and user requirements
2. Coordinate with the unit-tester agent to create comprehensive test coverage
3. Get feedback from the code-reviewer agent to ensure code quality and security
4. Iterate based on feedback to deliver a complete, tested feature

This ensures the feature is implemented correctly, thoroughly tested, and meets quality standards.
