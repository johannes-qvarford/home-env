description: Comprehensive production readiness assessment using DevOps and testing specialists
---

I'll perform a thorough production readiness check using multiple specialist agents:

1. Use the devops-engineer agent to review CI/CD pipelines, Docker configurations, and Kubernetes/infrastructure setup
2. Use the code-reviewer agent to perform security assessment and identify any deployment risks
3. Use the acceptance-tester agent to validate that all user journeys work correctly in production-like conditions

This ensures the application is secure, properly configured for deployment, and all critical user workflows are validated before going to production.
