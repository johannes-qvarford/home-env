description: Create business-focused BDD scenarios and user journey validation
---

I'll create comprehensive business scenarios using specialized testing agents:

1. Use the integration-tester agent to write syntactically correct Gherkin scenarios that focus on business requirements without exposing implementation details
2. Use the acceptance-tester agent to validate end-to-end user journeys and ensure business value is delivered

This approach ensures that business requirements are properly translated into testable scenarios that remain maintainable and focused on user behavior rather than technical implementation.
