description: Comprehensive code review using multiple specialist agents
---

I need to perform a comprehensive review of the code. I'll coordinate multiple specialist agents to ensure thorough coverage:

1. First, I'll use the code-reviewer agent to analyze the code for security vulnerabilities, edge cases, and code quality issues
2. Then I'll use the unit-tester agent to evaluate test coverage and suggest additional tests
3. Finally, I'll use the integration-tester agent to review any BDD scenarios and integration test coverage

Let me start with the code review analysis using the Task tool with the code-reviewer agent, then proceed with testing analysis.
