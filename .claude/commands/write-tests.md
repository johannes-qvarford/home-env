description: Create comprehensive test suite covering all testing layers
---

I'll create a complete test suite using multiple testing specialists to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. Use the unit-tester agent to create unit tests with edge case coverage and Given/When/Then structure
2. Use the integration-tester agent to write BDD scenarios in proper Gherkin format for business workflows
3. Use the acceptance-tester agent to create end-to-end acceptance tests for user journeys

This creates a complete test pyramid from unit tests through integration to acceptance testing, ensuring the code is thoroughly validated at all levels.
