# Introduction

Portable computer intended for programming, writing, browsing and general administration of the home network.

Uses windows with WSL for great software compatibility.

Can SSH into other devices and set them up remotely, except for router.

Is used to write home-env.

Programming is done using VSCode with Remote-WSL.

Fish is the shell of choice.

Javascript is the programming language of choice - it can be used for server backends and frontends, as well as scripts, with a relatively small memory footprint. A proper commercial product from me might not have the same setup.
