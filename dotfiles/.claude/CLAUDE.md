- Use "docker compose" instead of "docker-compose"
- Never try to execute commands that requires terminal access, like sudo. Always ask the user to perform those things.
- Use python3 when writing complex scripts.
- Add types to python scripts and run mypy after doing changes to verify that the types are correct.
- Do spontaneous refactorings to scripts you are editing if they help readability.
